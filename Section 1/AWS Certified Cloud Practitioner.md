**How Websites work:**

**CLIENT**    ----->        **NETWORK**      ------>        **SERVER**

The Client uses the network to route packets to server.

In order for customer to find website or vice versa, you need to have **IP addresses**. Just like you're sending post mail!

A server is composed of:
Compute: CPU
Memory: RAM

Storage: Data
Database: Store data in a structured way.

Network: Routers, switches, DNS Servers.

Network: Cables, routers, servers connected with each other.
Router: A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the Internet.

Switch: Takes a packet and sends it to the correct server/client on your network.

	**CLIENT** --->    **ROUTER** --->    **SWITCH** --->    **PC NETWORKS**

In order to externalize the traditional IT Infrastructure, this is where the cloud comes in.

# What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is the **on demand delivery** of compute power, database storage, application and other IT resources.

Through a cloud service platform with pay-as-you-go pricing meaning you only pay for what you need/when you requested it.

You can provision the exact right type and size of computing resources you need! Do you want a large server? Small sever? 1? 2?

You can access it almost instantly.

Its a simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services/

AWS owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these applications services, while you provision what you need via a web application.

**Deployment Models of the cloud:**

-**Private Cloud: Rackspace**
	- Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
	- Security for sensitive applications
	- Complete control
	- Meet specific business needs.

-**Public Cloud**: Microsoft Azure, google cloud, AWS
	-Cloud resources owned and operated by a third party cloud service provider delivered over the internet.
	-Six advantages of cloud computing.

-**Hybrid Cloud**: Keep some servers on premise and extend some capabilities to the cloud.
	-Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure.
	-Flexibility and lost effectiveness of the public cloud.


# FIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF CLOUD COMPUTING

1. On demand self service:
	- Users can use them on demand and without human interaction from the service provider.
2. Broad Network Access:
	- Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms.
3. Multi-Tenancy and resource pooling:
	- Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy.
4. Rapid Elasticity and scalability:
	- Automatically and quickly dispose resources when needed.
	- Quickly and easily scale based on demand.
5. Measured service:
	- Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used.


# Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. Trade capital expense(Capex) for operational expense(Opex)
	- Pay on demand, don't own any hardware.
	- Reduce TCO and Opex: TCO: Total Cost Ownership
2. Benefits from massive economies of scale.
	- Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale.
